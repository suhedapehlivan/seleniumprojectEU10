How to handle Closing or Quitting driver with Driver utility class?

--> When we created a new .getDriver() method in Driver utility class and implemeted Singleton design pattern.

--> This design pattern requires my driver to be "driver == null (true)" to be able to generate a new driver.

--> When we use default driver.quit() method that is coming from Selenium library, we terminate the existing driver session completely.

--> This creates issue for our existing structure. Since driver is not null or session is completely deleted/terminated, we cannot continue with our execution of following tests.

--> To solve this issue, we created Driver.closeDriver() method.
--> In this method 2 thing are happening:
    #1- We use driver.quit() to terminate the session and close browsers.
    #2- Set the driver session value back to "null", so rest of our tests can be executed.
